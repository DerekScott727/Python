friends = ["Rolf", "Jen", "Bob", "Anne"]



for friend in friends:                  ##The 'for  friend' line creates a new variable representing the first element in the list 'friends'
    print(f"{friend} is my friend.")    ##This prints the first element in the list friends, followed by the string 'is my friend'. because it loops, it will go to the next element and so on
